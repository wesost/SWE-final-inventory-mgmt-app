working code - literally copied everything from my local folder that I ran our demo from.


`npm install axios` required

### to run:

note: I have some issues with git bash (don't know why) so I use powershell instead and it works better for me


cd ./my-app-server and run `node index.js` to start server

cd ./src and run `npm run` to run app, should pop up in browser window. 
To test you can copy/paste code from exampleUPC.txt into lookup bar.
