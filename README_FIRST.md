I lost access to my university gitlab after graduating, so I'm unable to view my school projects. This is the most up to date version of my senior capstone SWE project I had on my laptop, and that I would not like to lose track of (though it is certainly not in a finished state, it does have the bulk of my contributions). My main work was done on backend/server.js and frontend/src/components/LandingPage.js
