# Meeting with Mekenna (2/20/2025)

Authors: Wes Ostlund, Luke Wagner

## Current process:
- Buy food products, weigh products, enter information into Excel spreadsheet

## Proposed solution:
- Application to automate the current process for inputting new food products. Will also track what items are leaving the food bank (students will scan items they take out).

### Major goals:
- Website to allow remote access for food bank administrators
- Make it easy and user-friendly to track what items are coming in and out of the food bank
- Project will implement a barcode scanner to track items coming in and out

### Admin view:
- Should be able to log into the admin view from the main page (what will be shown on the food bank computer)
- Useful analytics: What items are being taken and when people are taking them

### Information to store:
- Product Name
- Weight
- Location Purchased
- Price?
- ~~Expiration date~~ (Mekenna said we will not need to track this)

### Concerns to consider:
- Security/authentication for admin login

### Future ideas:
- Alerts for when things expire
- Trends over past week/month/weekend
- Most popular items

## Other points of contact:
- Todd Sandberg
- Christiana Holmes
