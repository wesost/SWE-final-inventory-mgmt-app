# Nutrition Center Inventory Management

**Product Vision:** 

 ##### GOAL: To create a streamlined, efficient, and user-friendly system that allows the Whitworth Nutrition Center to track the movement of food and health items. This system will enable the Nutrition Center to optimize inventory management and provide quick, easy-to-use scanning. The goal is to enhance the Whitworth Nutrition Center's ability to support students facing food insecurity.

 ##### TARGET AUDIENCE: Nutrition Center managers, students, and any staff that may be working to help in supporting students with food insecurity.

 ##### LONG-TERM VISION: By the end of the project, the system will empower food banks to make informed decisions on stock levels, manage resources efficiently, and ensure that students have access to the food and basic needs they require in a timely, transparent manner.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.


## Description
The Whitworth Nutrition Center requires a more streamlined solution to manage and track the data flowing in and out of their records in order to better support students facing food insecurity. The proposed solution involves implementing scanning technologies and a web interface, allowing administrators and managers to easily monitor, update, and track inventory levels, while also identifying trends to ensure that food is fresh and meets student needs. This system will enable more efficient resource allocation and provide staff with an easier way to track the status of the pantry and its contents. A key component of the system will involve student-facing scanning technology, where students will scan out items as they take them, ensuring that inventory is always up to date. The primary objective of this project is to modernize the Nutrition Center's food pantry, enhancing its ability to serve those in need more effectively. We can edit this as we decide on what tools we will use and what have you.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
